# react-virtual-dynamics

A React component for efficiently rendering large lists or grids of items using virtualization. This component improves performance by only rendering items that are currently visible in the viewport. Additionally, it supports infinite scrolling by dynamically loading more data as the user scrolls near the end of the list.

## Installation

To install the package, run:

```bash
npm install react-virtual-dynamics
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here is a basic example of how to use the `VirtualizedList` component:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { VirtualizedList } from "react-virtual-dynamics";

const data = Array.from({ length: 1000 }).map((_, i) => i + 1);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <VirtualizedList
      dataLength={data.length}
      viewportHeight={500}
      itemHeight={100}
      gap={10}
      renderItem={(index, style) => (
        <div key={index} style={style}>
          {data[index]}
        </div>
      )}
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```

| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dataLength`     | `number`                                                         |         | The total number of items in the data set.                                              |
| `viewportHeight` | `number`                                                         |         | The height of the viewport for the virtualized list.                                    |
| `gridColumns`    | `number`                                                         | `1`     | The number of columns for grid layout. Set to `1` for a single column (list layout).    |

| `isLoading`      | `boolean`                                                        | `false` | Optional boolean to show a loading indicator when more items are being loaded.          |
| `renderItem`     | `(index: number, style: React.CSSProperties) => React.ReactNode` |         | Function to render an item. Receives the index and a style object for positioning.      |
| `itemHeight`     | `number`                                                         |         | The height of a single item.                                                            |
| `gap`            | `number`                                                         |         | The gap between items in the grid.                                                      |

### Example with Infinite Scrolling and Load More

This example demonstrates how to use the `VirtualizedList` component with infinite scrolling. The `loadMore` function is triggered to load additional items as the user scrolls near the bottom of the list.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { VirtualizedList } from "react-virtual-dynamics";

const initialData = Array.from({ length: 200 }).map((_, i) => i + 1);

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(initialData);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  const loadMore = () => {
    if (!isLoading) {
      setIsLoading(true);
      setTimeout(() => {
        const moreData = Array.from({ length: 20 }).map(
          (_, i) => data.length + i + 1
        );
        setData([...data, ...moreData]);
        setIsLoading(false);
      }, 1000);
    }
  };

  return (
    <VirtualizedList
      dataLength={data.length}
      viewportHeight={500}
      gridColumns={4}
      itemHeight={100}
      gap={10}
      loadMore={loadMore}
      isLoading={isLoading}
      renderItem={(index, style) => (
        <div key={index} style={style}>
          {data[index]}
        </div>
      )}
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is react-virtual-dynamics different from react-virtualized?

React-virtual-dynamics is designed to be a smaller, faster alternative to react-virtualized, with a more beginner-friendly API. If react-virtual-dynamics meets your needs, it is recommended over react-virtualized for most cases. However, if you need features specific to react-virtualized, you have two options:

1. Use react-virtualized.
2. Extend react-virtual-dynamics with custom components to add the required functionality.

### Can a list or a grid fill 100% the width or height of a page?

Yes, by using the react-virtualized-auto-sizer package.

### Why is my list blank when I scroll?

Ensure you are attaching the style parameter to the DOM elements you render. This is necessary for correct positioning.

### Can I lazy load data for my list?

Yes, use the loadMore prop to implement lazy loading.

### Can I add padding to the top and bottom of a list?

Yes, although it requires inline styling.

### Can I add gutter or padding between items?

Yes, although it requires inline styling.

### Does this library support "sticky" items?

Yes, with a bit of user code.
